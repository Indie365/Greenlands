# greenlands

This repo contains the code for `greenlands`, a platform that can be used to run
games between _AI agents_ and human players in Minecraft, and collect metrics
throughout the games.

We're still in the process of cleaning up the documentation (and this README), but
the code of the platform is complete. 

Here you can see an example of a human giving instructions to an agent and how said
agent attempts to fulfill the human's requests (see full video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWrvLhQDybw)).
